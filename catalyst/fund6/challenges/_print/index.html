<h1 id=pg-9bb4938894767178de4261e875abe2f9>1 - Atala PRISM DID Mass-Scale Adoption</h1>
<p>What will drive mass-scale adoption of decentralized IDs on Cardano?</p>
<p>Fund Size: <strong>$250,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p>
<p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26116>Campaign page</a> and <a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26116/stage/unspecified>browse ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2>
<p>Propose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem (preferably Atala PRISM when released). This can include any method that will offer users or entities a decentralized ID to start defining their digital self-sovereignty. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.</p>
<p>We are a community of thought leaders and it is time to demonstrate our thoughts with actions. Using a Decentralized Identification (DID) technology to establish self-sovereign presence and ownership of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) advances decentralization of institutions; benefiting individuals and entities.</p>
<p>This Challenge is about small ways we can incorporate DIDs into the Cardano ecosystem to start the ground swell at the grassroots that demands PII be secured and controlled with DID technologies and standards.</p>
<p>It is about <strong>signaling to the world</strong> that the Cardano community plans mass-adoption of DID that is interchangeable, interoperable (by WW DID standards) and <strong>we care deeply that the origin of our personal DID is tied to our home blockchain—Cardano.</strong></p>
<p>While we prefer to support Atala PRISM&rsquo;s instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be lost on IOHK how the community responses to this Challenge. Should IOHK see a ground swell of great ideas and proposals, that could help them justify expediting timelines for their planned open sourcing of PRISM components.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Atala PRISM DID is a gateway to the Cardano blockchain and ecosystem. Building technology and marketecture that on-boards users is crucial.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-success-look-like>How does success look like?</h2>
<p>Many high quality ideas will be proposed that can substantially grow Cardano&rsquo;s user-base, network-utility, network-value & ADA circulation.</p>
<h2 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h2>
<ul>
<li>The number of proposals that directly address DID use cases in a quantifiable manner.</li>
<li>The quality of proposals measured by community interest and engagement.</li>

<h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2>
<p>Blockchain systems are a complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components that rely and are used by many stakeholders from different geographies and backgrounds. These systems are not isolated from the real world and unexpected threats may emerge from the dynamic interaction.</p>
<p>Cardano stakeholders (users, SPOs, DApp developers, partners, Exchanges, governments, companies) need a resilient system that is able to identify and grade developing threats to its own existence.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Cardano complexity increases with decentralization, native tokens, multi-asset support, smart contracts and new users. Threats will emerge.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-success-look-like>How does success look like?</h2>
<p>Stable evolution. Cardano successfully onboards new users, developers, DApps, tokens, SPOs, oracles, companies. Threats are identified</p>
<h2 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h2>
<p>At the end of this challenge, we should be asking ourselves: Did we manage to create a simple mechanism for identifying novel, emerging systemic threats to the Cardano ecosystem? We can&rsquo;t see the future now, but as events unfold we may be able to use our collective wisdom and senses to detect new dangers for the Cardano blockchain and its usage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of potential threats that have been submitted.</li>
<li>Grading of the submitted threats by urgency</li>
<li>Number of threats that have been identified as serious and systemic.</li>
<li>Grouping of threat sources into categories and types to determine wider danger areas</li>
<li>Number of Cardano stakeholders interacting with the threat alert mechanism</li>
<li>Number of Catalyst proposals submitted and accepted for funding in subsequent funding rounds to directly address the most pressing identified threats.</li>

<p>Disaster recovery (DR) is an area of security planning that aims to protect an organization from the effects of significant negative events.</p>
<p>Having a disaster recovery strategy in place enables an organization to maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption.</p>
<p>Cardano as a proposed financial operating system for the world must have several layers of built in redundancies even for events that may seem remote or very unlikely now.</p>
<p>Although a testnet exists, real-world conditions can never be fully replicated. Maybe proposers can develop a way of incentivizing further SPO participation in the Cardano testnet and more simulations.</p>

<p>How do we seed and grow Cardano in Africa?</p>
<p>Fund Size: <strong>$200,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p>

<h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2>
<h3 id=africa-is-fertile-ground-for-the-adoption-of-cardano>Africa is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano.</h3>
<p>Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win, because they get the signal of support from our community. Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment for mass adoption anywhere.</p>
<p>Focussing on Africa is a strategy that has often been promoted and is openly pursued by IOG and Charles Hoskinson</p>
<p>The ROI is likely to be high because community sponsored projects are better run in young and developing economies.</p>
<h2 id=what-this-is>What this is:</h2>
<p>A call to activate the Cardano community&rsquo;s ability to recognise, risk and reward this opportunity to make the world a better place.</p>
<h2 id=what-this-is-not>What this is not:</h2>
<p>This is not a proposal that needs active work by the proposers, it is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. If it succeeds the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the environmental benefits many of us were born with. Giving them an opportunity to show that circumstances are not something they need charity to rise above and succeed. All that is required is the equal opportunity to succeed or fail that many of the rest of us enjoy, but with their hinderances and hurdles lessened and their choices remaining in their own hands.</p>
<h2 id=regardless-of-whether-it-succeeds-or-fails>Regardless of whether it succeeds or fails:</h2>
<p>I have had my eyes opened and my mind changed about the potential of Africa. From Africa&rsquo;s bankers in the west, ex-pats with vision and heart, youth with passions, documentaries that challenged my assumptions and Cardano community members with so much to give.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h2>

<h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2>
<p>When Fund7 happens we will be close to 100 funded proposals. It is extremely important that these proposals are evaluated/audited to see if they are delivering and if the ROI is being in line with what has been established initialy.</p>
<p>Currently, IOG is in charge of monitoring the development of these funded proposals, but when there are hundreds of funded proposals this will be an overwhelming work for IOG.</p>
<p>The Auditability challenge aims to ensure transparency in the use of Cardano&rsquo;s treasury resources, which will allow the Cardano community to have more information on the development of funded proposals through a checks and balances system.</p>
<p>Some directions that this challenge can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Podcasts with teams from funded proposals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart contract audits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platforms / Websites that perform:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting on metrics, spending of financial resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metrics on the development of Dapps (txs, volume, unique wallets, etc …)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metrics on Number of onboarded developers, number of commits in funded proposal repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media engagement indicators metrics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h2>

<h2 id=campaign-brief>Campaign Brief</h2>
<p>With transaction metadata, Cardano can be utilized as a network to store small proofs of events or documents. This utility has been used in the past to implement product anti-counterfeit solutions as well as traceability solutions. Smart contracts are not necessary to take advantage of this functionality.</p>
<p>This challenge is for you if you have problems that involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate to external parties that a specific document has not been tampered with.</li>
<li>Demonstrate to external parties that a specific event took place.</li>
<li>Demonstrate to external parties that a document existed at a specific date/time.</li>
<li>Demonstrate any or all of the above without revealing the document or the event&rsquo;s data (because of privacy concerns).</li>
</ul>
<p>IOHK is pleased to announce that we will support and provide expert advice to the proposal winners. The same team that created the New Balance and Beefchain solutions will be offering these services to the proposal winners for 6 months after the winners are announced:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 hr a week of expert advice from IOHK&rsquo;s solutions architects and technical consultants.</li>
<li>Email address for offline queries.</li>
<li>Architectural/design/technical reviews.</li>

<p>Prototypes are built that utilize metadata to solve real life problems. The prototypes are presented to the Catalyst community in any of the town halls.</p>
<h2 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key metrics to measure</h2>
<p>At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential amount of users that can be brought onto Cardano.</li>
<li>Community feedback (positive/negative) about the prototypes after presentation.</li>
<li>Followup Catalyst proposals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Propose a means or way to drive business use cases on Cardano that have NFT usage as a core component and can act as an onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. This can include any business model based on NFTs. Think about how this is implemented at scale drawing millions of users, who, once onboard, can become customers for dApps, tools, DeFi and other services.</p>
<p>This Challenge is about building recurring businesses that incorporate NFTs on the Cardano ecosystem. The more types of NFTs that are circulating on Cardano will increase the utility of Cardano and ADA.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-be-proposed>What should be proposed?</h2>
<p>Proposals should be framed towards specific use-cases, and the community will know of specific cases where NFTs can be used to solve various problems. Focusing on NFTs in general may be most productive, with a strong focus on business models that rely on NFTs as a core component of most transactions.</p>
